      <h1>reduce.ac: A framework over <a href="http://thi.ng/umbrella">@thi.ng/umbrella</a></h1>
<p>Framework components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An event-stream based (translucent) web app framework covering architectural needs such as:
<ul>
<li>universal (browser/server) routing</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>uses pattern matching for routing</li>
<li>agnostic to where the user enters the app</li>
<li>deeplinks are supported via &quot;intelligent hydration&quot;</li>
<li>Not coupled to rendering/view, it's &quot;just data&quot; (mostly)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uses <code>@thi.ng/associative</code> <code>EquivMap</code> for pattern matching</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Simple path:
paths are represented as an ordered list (Array)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>URL: https://example.com/parent/child

parses to:
{ path: [parent, child] }
</code></pre>
<p>Path with params:
params are represented as an EquivMap (key, value pairs)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>URL: https://example.com/parent/child?query=just+for+looks

parses to:
{ path: [parent, child], params: {query: &quot;just for looks&quot;} }
</code></pre>
<h3>Intelligent Hydration</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways a user may enter a web app:</p>
<ol>
<li>from the home page (e.g., <code>/</code>)</li>
<li>from a deeplink (e.g., <code>/parent/child</code>): via shared link or bookmark</li>
<li>through a link from another page within the same app (e.g., <code>./child</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p><code>hurl</code> intercepts both direct links and click events on link elements and runs through this decision-tree:</p>
<ol>
<li>if it's a relative link (from within the app) it concats a lens from the current path with the relative one</li>
<li>if it's a direct link from outside (e.g., a shared link), it requests the state needed to build the page (See &quot;Hydration Strategy&quot;)</li>
<li>if it's an absolute link from within the app, it diffs the current path with the new one to only request the needed (additional) state</li>
</ol>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p>Basic dispatch on pattern:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-js"><code>import { EquivMap } from &quot;@thi.ng/associative&quot;
import * as P from &quot;@thi.ng/paths&quot;
import { Home, Parent, Child, Four0Four } from &quot;./specs&quot; // cursor+spec components

let route_match = args => {
  let { path, params } = parse_URL(args) // TDB
  return new EquivMap([
    [{path: [&quot;&quot;]}, Home],
    [{path: [&quot;parent&quot;], params }, Parent()(params)],
    [{path: [&quot;parent&quot;, &quot;child&quot;], params }, Parent(Child)(params)],
  ]).get(parse_URL(args) || Four0Four(path, params)
}
// browser
history.addListener(&quot;popState&quot;, (a, b, c) => TBD(a, b)(route_match(c)))

</code></pre>
<h4>Hydration Strategy</h4>
<p><code>hurl</code> follows the principle of &quot;view as a function of state&quot;, but gives you the means by which to construct your view from the URL</p>
<p>There are a few elements that come into play here:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the root of the app a URL listener is registered</li>
<li>This is a bi-directional listener, i.e., changes/entries into the URL trigger events and events can trigger changes/entries to the URL</li>
<li>The URL is the &quot;command center&quot; for all lower-level logic (the logic hub)</li>
<li>Pattern matching is used to determine what logic is deployed based on the path and params</li>
<li>Patterns are associated with functions that are completely naive (and probably composed of) from de-coupled/independent functionality</li>
<li>Each path is associated with a lens into a global App state</li>
</ol>
<h3>Global App State</h3>
<p>The global application state is a <code>@thi.ng/atom</code>, which has a number of useful features we'll need to implement the intelligent hydration</p>
<ol>
<li>Atom can be immutably manipulated via lensed &quot;cursors&quot; (paths) into the data structure</li>
<li>Any changes made to the Atom can trigger events (bi-directionality functionality) to subscribers/consumers of the Atom</li>
<li>Derived views can be made on top of the atom, which provide a read-only view of the data. This will be where we instrument our views/rendering functionality</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to implement the intelligent hydration, the app state needs to be able to make remote resource requests for data in order to fullfil any views, which require such data.</p>
<p>Say the user gets a shared link from one of her friends to: https://example.com/parent/child. Here's what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>The URL listener gets the path: [parent, child]</li>
<li>a dispatcher looks for data within the global Atom associated with that path</li>
<li>if the data is not empty or <code>null</code> (non falsy), that data is presented (i.e., the state is already hydrated, probably from earlier navigation/service worker cache)</li>
<li>if the data is falsy, the pattern associated with that path can make the necessary resource requests to hydrate the atom to fulfill the view</li>
</ol>
<p>Hence, the Pattern matching functionality here is the hub of the logic, implementing:</p>
<ol>
<li>route matches</li>
<li>resource requirements and fetching arguments (which might also be contained in the URL as params) for the route</li>
<li>any view that is associated with that path</li>
</ol>
<h2>Views</h2>
<p>It's up to the dev to decide what to do with the data. This is completely agnostic.</p>
<p>The way this could be implemented with <code>@thi.ng/hdom</code> is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>use <code>deeptransform</code> transducer, which takes an <code>hdom</code> &quot;spec&quot; and applies it to the data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Route/View Transitions</h2>
<p>The router can also be stateful. Consider a user which transitions between two routes with significantly different layouts/views. It would be nice if these transitions would be animated to make them less &quot;janky&quot;. I.e., we can keep track of the rendering of the views and record the location of the previous components. Once a user initiates a transition, the diff between the previous and new views can be used to instrument a FLIP transition animation between components/elements that exist on both states and a disolve/fade transition can be applied to the elements leaving/entering between frames.</p>
<p>Instead of applying this transducer to the actual view (hdom), we would only record the actual rendered position of the last frame (lazily) and attach it to the state/Atom of the previous state, then use that state to calculate the styles for the next view and attach it as styles to the new view. Each state treated as a single element within a collection of TBD state (frame) items. This should be done either via <code>id</code> or a <code>class</code> that specifies such tracking should be &quot;turned on&quot; to instrument the animation calculation efficiently (i.e., not on every element naively)</p>
<p>This can be implemented by dynamically adorning the deeptransform <code>spec</code>s with the needed styles to be deployed on an ad-hoc basis (dynamic render spec formulation/instrumentation)</p>
<p>This the components of this part are as follows:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>router as a dynamic dispatch function based on pattern recognition</li>
<li>page states as elements of a collection of routing states</li>
<li>stateful transducer that formulates the next view 'spec' based on a static/config spec and some dynamic FLIP calcuations (consider <code>@thi.ng/transducers-fsm</code>)</li>
<li>spec application to page state (data separated from view)</li>
<li>view rendering and animation via specs</li>
</ol>
<h2>API-first Design</h2>
<p>With this design, the web app could be instrumented so that by &quot;flipping a switch&quot; (e.g., via prepending <code>api</code> -&gt; https://api.example.com/parent/child), the raw/JSON data view could be shown instead of the rendered markup.</p>
<p>The pattern matching for this could be as easy as creating one pattern matching function that responds to routes after the base URL and then - a super ordinate - pattern match that (depending on whether or not <code>api</code> is prepended) renders either the hdom components or just returns JSON data (without specs applied)</p>
<h2>Benefits and Trade-offs</h2>
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<ol>
<li>This design requires more forethought in design of an application as the rendered view is the last step in the process, whereas - in a conventional web app design - you may start &quot;with the end in mind&quot; (i.e., views) and work your way up to the logic</li>
<li>This design is more difficult than an ad-hoc design pipeline and may lend itself less to a conventional design -&gt; implementation workflow (with the respective division of labor between them). I.e., the rendered view needs to be intimately &quot;aware&quot; of the data structure (not the other way around).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ol>
<li>This is a de-coupled approach to web app architecture; it avails itself as both a purely data-oriented approach (and thus agnostic to whether or not the data is precalculated from remote servers or dynamically accumulated via user-initiated client-side event streams</li>
<li>Since the view is rather superficially applied to the state/data, it can be imagined that one might target alternative rendering targets (via alternative &quot;specs&quot;) with the same routing/data-hydration architecture (e.g., web, mobile-native, smart-watch, IOT, etc.)</li>
</ol>
